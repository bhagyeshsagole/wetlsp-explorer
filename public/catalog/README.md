# Bundled site catalog

`wetlsp_site_catalog.csv` is the catalog the app loads at startup so the Overview
world map and the Catalog view work offline, before anything is uploaded.

This is the real `wetlsp_cyverse_site_catalog_final.csv` export, installed from
`wetlsp-data/` on 2026-09-18: 95 sites, all with latitude and longitude, with
availability columns for 2021–2024. Coordinates are copied from the source.

To update the bundled catalog:

```sh
npm run catalog:import -- /path/to/wetlsp_cyverse_site_catalog_final.csv
```

That validates the file, reports how many sites and how many have coordinates,
and copies it into place. Rebuild and the world map is populated.

Users can also load a catalog at runtime — **Settings → Site catalog → Load
catalog file** accepts the same CSV (or a JSON array of the same fields) and it
overrides the bundled copy for that browser.

## Columns

| column | required | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `site_id` | yes | joins to uploaded site folders (`CA-DB2`, `US-Myb`, …) |
| `site_name` | no | display name |
| `country` | no | ISO name or code |
| `lat`, `lon` | no | WGS84 decimal degrees; a site without both is listed but not mapped |
| `base_network` | no | AmeriFlux, FLUXNET, … |
| `tower_height_m`, `canopy_height_m` | no | metres |
| `wetlsp_<year>` | no | availability flag; `1`/`true`/`yes` mean available |

Any other column is preserved and shown in the Catalog table.
