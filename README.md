# WetLSP Explorer

Explore wetland vegetation through the seasons. Open a WetLSP site folder to
view EVI time series, select pixels on a map, and compare annual phenology.

A desktop app for **Mac** and **Windows**. Your data stays on your computer.

## Download

**[→ Get the latest release](https://github.com/bhagyeshsagole/wetlsp-explorer/releases/latest)**

Open **Assets** on that page and pick the file for your computer:

| Your computer | File ending in |
| --- | --- |
| Mac, Apple silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4 or newer) | `mac-arm64.dmg` |
| Mac, Intel processor | `mac-x64.dmg` |
| Windows 10 or 11 | `win-x64.exe` |

Not sure which Mac you have? **Apple menu → About This Mac**.

Skip the **Source code** archives — those are for developers, not installation.

<details>
<summary><strong>The download page shows 404</strong></summary>

The repository is private. Sign in with a GitHub account the lab has invited,
or ask the lab to send you the installer file directly. You do not need a
GitHub account to use a file someone shares with you.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>My computer warns me not to open it</strong></summary>

Expected — these lab builds are not signed with a paid Apple or Microsoft
certificate. You confirm once, then it never asks again.

**Mac:** double-click the app, click **Done** on the warning, then go to
**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway** and confirm **Open**.
**Windows:** **More info → Run anyway**.

If a Mac instead says the app is **damaged**, you have a release older than
v1.0.3 — download the latest one.

Only do this for installers from this repository or your lab.

## Open your first site

To try the app straight away, click **Download sample sites** on the start
screen. It fetches five wetland sites (CA-DSM, FR-LGt, BR-SM1, US-BZF, CZ-Wet;
1.3 GB) from the lab's [public data release](https://github.com/bhagyeshsagole/wetlsp-sample-data/releases/tag/v1)
and opens the first one. After that download, the sites work offline. To add
your own data:

1. Click **Upload folder**.
2. Choose a site folder such as **CA-DB2**, a folder holding several sites, or
   a folder of the `.zip` files Google Drive downloads. Each site is found and
   imported separately.
3. Wait for the import to finish, then pick a view.

You can also drag folders or `.zip` files onto the window, or pick individual
files. Both single-file and batched `_ds` datasets work.

## The five views

| View | Use it to |
| --- | --- |
| **Overview** | Locate a site; check its dates, pixel coverage, years, and metadata. |
| **Time Series** | Line chart of daily mean EVI with its interquartile band and estimated green-up, peak and green-down dates; overlay years; show every pixel; export results. |
| **Pixel Map** | Select pixels or draw a region, then inspect that selection's time series. |
| **Phenometrics** | Examine timing, greenness, and quality layers; compare up to four site-years. |
| **Catalog** | Search the bundled 95-site catalog and export site information. |

---

## Your data

Everything is processed and stored on your own computer. Nothing is uploaded.

The installer bundles the app, the site catalog, and the scientific readers, so
you can import and analyze local files **without internet** — including on first
launch. Only basemap imagery needs a connection.

Keep your original dataset folders as your permanent copy. Imported sites and
preferences are stored separately from the app, so they survive updates.

Imported data can use up to **50 GB**, or less if your disk has less free
space. When an import would go over, the app asks you to delete a site first.
Manage sites in **Settings → Storage**. Deleted sample sites can be downloaded
again from **Settings → Sample sites**.

### Figures

Every chart and map has **PNG** and **Copy** buttons. Copy puts the image on
the clipboard for slides or chat. Shortcuts: **⌘S** / **Ctrl+S** saves, and
**⌘⇧C** / **Ctrl+Shift+C** copies. Exports carry a title with the site, year
and sample size. The **⋯** menu adds a vector SVG, a 1920×1080 slide PNG, CSVs,
and a ready-to-paste figure caption that describes exactly what is plotted.

## Updates

Manual for now: close the app, download the new installer from
[Releases](https://github.com/bhagyeshsagole/wetlsp-explorer/releases/latest),
and install it over your existing copy. [Details](SETUP.md#updates-and-saved-data).

## Data sources and attribution

WetLSP Explorer is a viewer. It does not include or process satellite imagery.

- **WetLSP products.** The site folders the app opens (annual
  `*-wetlsp-<year>.nc` phenometric NetCDFs and the `pixels_*` Parquet tables
  of daily EVI) are Wetland Land Surface Phenology (WetLSP) products made by
  the Ecosystem and Planetary Health Integration Lab (ecoϕlab) at the
  University of Illinois Chicago with the
  [WetLSP pipeline](https://github.com/McNicol-Lab/WetLSP). That pipeline is a
  fork of the [PLSP](https://github.com/BU-LCSC/PLSP) algorithms from Boston
  University's Land Cover & Surface Climate Group (Moon et al., 2022), updated
  for FLUXNET-CH4 wetland sites. PlanetScope surface reflectance scenes
  (2021–2024) are filtered and converted to EVI, then gap-filled and smoothed
  with a spline to give daily per-pixel EVI. Annual phenometrics (green-up,
  peak, green-down, EVI amplitude, quality flags, and so on) are then computed
  using the definitions in Moon et al. (2022). Published WetLSP data are the
  annual phenometrics and the spline-smoothed daily EVI. Per-acquisition
  (unsmoothed) EVI values are an internal processing step and are not
  distributed.
- **PlanetScope imagery.** The PlanetScope imagery (2021–2024) was obtained
  through the [NASA Commercial Satellite Data Acquisition (CSDA) Program](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/csda/vendor-planet/).
  Includes copyrighted material of Planet Labs PBC. All rights reserved.
  Published WetLSP data are limited to annual phenometrics and gap-filled,
  spline-smoothed daily EVI. They are shared as Derived Products under the
  [CSDA Program EULA for Planet Data](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3fs-public/2022-02/Planet_Expanded_EULA_06-21.pdf).
  Raw PlanetScope scenes, surface reflectance bands, per-acquisition
  (unsmoothed) index values, and Planet quality masks are **not** distributed
  with this app, its installers, or the sample data. If you publish figures or
  results made with the app, credit Planet and CSDA as described in
  [References and how to cite](#references-and-how-to-cite).
- **Sample sites and catalog.** The sample sites come from the lab's
  [wetlsp-sample-data](https://github.com/bhagyeshsagole/wetlsp-sample-data/releases/tag/v1)
  release. The bundled 95-site catalog ([details](public/catalog/README.md)) is
  the WetLSP site catalog. Site IDs (for example `US-BZF`) follow FLUXNET
  naming and refer to eddy-covariance flux tower sites. The catalog's
  `base_network` column lists AmeriFlux and European flux network
  affiliations. The app contains no flux-tower measurements.
- **Basemaps.** Map backgrounds are loaded at runtime from OpenFreeMap
  (OpenStreetMap data) and Esri World Imagery, with attribution shown on the
  map. They are not PlanetScope imagery.

  EVI), which have their own terms. The WetLSP NetCDF files list
  `license = CC-BY-4.0` in their metadata.
- **PlanetScope imagery**, including raw scenes, reflectance bands,
  per-acquisition index values, and quality masks. These are copyrighted by

either. Ask their authors before reusing that code.
